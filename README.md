Now let’s briefly discuss the four bullet points above.

Why use the className attribute in the JSX syntax?

Well, with JSX, it looks like HTML so much that it's easy to forget that it's actually JavaScript code - not HTML.

While regular HTML does indeed have a class attribute, which is used to list one or more CSS classes to be used on a given HTML element, this cannot really work in JSX. The reason is that JSX is a special kind of JavaScript syntax, and the word class is a reserved keyword in JSX. That's why the React team had to make a compromise and so className is used in JSX to list one or more CSS classes to be used on a given element or component.

But why use Intro1.js, Intro2.js, and Intro3.js? Isn't one of the tenets of coding the DRY approach - that is, the "Don't repeat yourself" approach?

Indeed, it is. However, there are still a few concepts to discuss before you learn how to re-use a single component with variations in its content. This has to do with data in components, but don’t worry, we’ll be getting to that later. 

The third question is about the props object. It has been mentioned before, but so far it hasn't been used. It hasn’t been used in this example either.

The answer to this question has to do with the next lesson, titled Component Use and Styling. In this lesson, you’ll see in practice how you can make components work better, with the help of props.

The final question is about not using the <a> element for empty links in my app.

The answer here depends on whether those links are "internal" - inside an app, or "external", meaning, leading to some external link, such as

. If the links are internal to the app - as they are envisioned here - using the <a> tag is simply not the React way of doing things. You'll learn why that is the case when discussing the use of React Router.
